# Road Segmentation with U-Net

This project implements a U-Net-based deep learning pipeline for road segmentation from satellite images. The workflow includes patch extraction, model training, and visualization of results.

## 🚀 Web Application

Try the live demo: Upload your satellite images and get road segmentation predictions in real-time!



## Results
Below are three test examples from the trained model (input, ground truth, and prediction shown in order for each test):

## Dataset
- **Input:** Satellite images and their corresponding binary road masks.
- **Format:** Images and masks are stored as 256x256 PNG patches in `dataset/patches/images` and `dataset/patches/masks`.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Extract Patches (if needed)
If you have original TIFF images, run:
```
python extract_patches.py
```
This will create 256x256 patches in `dataset/patches/images` and `dataset/patches/masks`.

### 3. Train the Model
```
python train.py
```
- Training uses all available patches.
- The best model (by validation Dice score) is saved as `best_model.pth`.

### 4. Visualize Results
```
python visualize.py
```
- Shows side-by-side input, ground truth, and predicted mask for random samples.

## Model
- **Architecture:** U-Net (configurable input/output channels)
- **Loss:** Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits
- **Metric:** Dice Coefficient
